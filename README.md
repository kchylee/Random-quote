# Random Quote Generator
This app is based on one of the FreeCodeCamp projects. It was built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery<br/>

## User stories
1. Users can click a button to show a new random quote.<br/>
2. Users can press a button to tweet out a quote.<br/>

## Getting started
1. Fork/clone this repository.<br/>
2. `cd` into the `Random-quote` folder. <br/>
3. In your commandline, type `open index.html` <br/>
4. The Random Quote Generator should be up and running in your default browser.

## Getting quotes
This project adopted a messenger-like layout and animation:<br/>
1. Users can get a random quote from the <a href="https://market.mashape.com/andruxnet/random-famous-quotes">Random Famout Quotes</a> API by clicking on the "Said what???" chat bubble.<br/>
2. As soon as a quote is retrieved from the API, it is displayed in an opposing chat bubble. Here users would have the option of tweeting quote (<i>to be added</i>) as well as learning more about the famous person by clicking on the "famous person who?" chat bubble.

## Updates
The app is live on Github pages: https://kchylee.github.io/Random-quote/. 
Expect improvement such as jQuery animation to simulate typing of the chat bubble contents, better responsiveness (media queries), and a tweet button.
